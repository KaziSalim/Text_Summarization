Three videos released by the Italian brand showed Zuo struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks. \"I received many threats online. Myself, my agent and my family got harassed through phone calls and emails,\" she said. A 49-year-old UK woman named Pascale Sellick says she is in \"love\" with her duvet (a soft quilt filled with feathers or synthetic fibre) and wants to 'marry' it on February 10. Sellick says that it's the \"longest, strongest, most intimate, and reliable relationship\" she has ever had. The wedding's dress code is dressing gowns, pyjamas, onesies and slippers.  The Congress has said that it's struggling to find enough helicopters to ferry its leaders for Lok Sabha election campaigning. \"Most of them have been cornered by the BJP because they have massive resources and money at their disposal. They've pre-booked most of the fleets,\" Congress leader Anand Sharma alleged. Denying the charge, BJP called Congress a \"machine of lies\". Aamir Khan screened his upcoming short film 'Rubaru Roshni' for Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in Bengaluru. Sharing a picture with Sri Sri, Aamir wrote, \"Always bringing joy and laughter into our lives, thank you...Guruji for your love, warmth and wisdom.\" The film, directed by Svati Chakravarty Bhatkal, will release on January 26. Amrita Rao, who plays Bal Thackeray's wife Meena Thackeray in the upcoming biopic 'Thackeray', said it was \"an honour\" for her to portray the Shiv Sena founder's wife in the film. \"When you're playing a real character, there are people associated emotionally with it...So, it comes with baggage and responsibility,\" she added. 'Thackeray' is set to release on January 25.  Kangana Ranaut, who was threatened by the Karni Sena for voicing her dissent against them, said she won't apologise as she hasn't done anything wrong. Earlier, Kangana had responded to the Karni Sena's threats against her film 'Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi', and had said she would \"destroy\" each of them. Kangana further said the film doesn't show anything \"offensive\". Sharing a picture with US talk show host Jimmy Fallon, Anupam Kher wrote, \"When you meet someone whose work you admire, says he's a fan of your work, it's a wonderful and...humbling feeling.\" \"Thank you dear [Jimmy Fallon] for your warmth, appreciation and generosity,\" Anupam added. The actor met Jimmy in New York while shooting for his show 'New Amsterdam'.  An erotic drawing by late rapper Tupac Shakur was sold at an auction for $21,155.75 (over â¹15 lakh), as per reports. The artwork was reportedly part of a love letter to his then-girlfriend Desiree, which he sent while serving a prison sentence for sexual abuse in 1995. The drawing was bought by a man in his 60s, reports said."
